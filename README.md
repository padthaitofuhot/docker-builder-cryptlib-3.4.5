# Docker Builder Cryptlib 3.4.5
This builds the last known stable version of Peter Gutmann's Cryptlib which is consumable by most BBS clients and servers. I found building cryptlib to be.. fickle. So I made this using my Docker Builder template for stubborn builds.  This one uses an Ubuntu Xenial LTS release image and compiles without any fuss.

# Dependencies
